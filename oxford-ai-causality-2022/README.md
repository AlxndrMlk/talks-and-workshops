# Causality: An Introduction

This is the repository for the talk **Causal Inference: An Introduction** (90 mins)

### Abstract
The goal of this session is to provide the audience with solid understanding of contemporary causality landscape. The talk starts with motivating examples. Next, a set of important theoretical tools is presented. Section 3 presents connections between graphs and causality. In sections 4 and 5 we show how to conduct a well-structured causal inference process, discussing both â€“ theory and practice. Section 6 is focused on connections between causality and machine learning. Finally, in section 7 we explore the fascinating world of causal discovery, starting with classic algorithms and finishing with the bleeding-edge research on the verge of causality and reinforcement learning.
