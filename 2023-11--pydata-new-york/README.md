# The Causal Toolbox: A Practical Guide to Causality in Python (For The Perplexed)

Nov 2, 2023, New York

Traditional machine learning methods leverage associations between variables in order to learn the patterns of variability in the dataset of interest.

This is great when we want to predict the next most likely token or classify a data point. Yet, when decision-making is at stakes, these models usually cannot provide us with a clear solution.

A person with a relatively high probability of churn, might react negatively to a promotional content we send them and churn, because of this content. This scenario cannot be effectively modeled in a traditional churn prediction framework and requires a causal approach.

In the talk we’ll demonstrate why this is the case. We’ll discuss theoretical and practical underpinnings of causal models and demonstrate how to implement them in Python.

The talk is addressed to people who want to enrich their data science toolbox and learn about one of the currently hottest sub-fields of artificial intelligence.

In the talk we’ll focus on building the practical understanding of the topic and we’ll use a mixture of hands-on and theoretical approaches.
