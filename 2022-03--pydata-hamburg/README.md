### Abstract
Over the last decade, causal inference gained a lot of traction in academia and in the industry. Causal models can be immensely helpful in various areas â€“ from marketing to medicine and from finance to cybersecurity. To make these models work, we need not only data as in traditional machine learning, but also a causal structure. Traditional way to obtain the latter is through well-designed experiments. Unfortunately, experiments can be tricky â€“ difficult to design, expensive or unethical. Causal discovery (also known as structure learning) is an umbrella term that describes several families of methods aiming at discovering causal structure from observational (non-experimental) data. During the talk, we will review the basics of causal inference and introduce the concept of causal discovery. Next, we will discuss differences between various approaches to causal discovery. Finally, we will see a series of practical examples of causal discovery using Python.
